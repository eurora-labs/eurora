# agent-chain

This crate is a Rust rewrite of the langchain 1.0 library. It currently supports OpenAI, Anthropic, and Ollama. And has additional support for Specta. It has very basic support for those things. If you have a use case and are missing some functionality, I would be more than happy to implement it if you make an issue on [Github](https://github.com/eurora-labs/eurora/issues)


It has been designed to be as much of a drop-in replacement for langchain as possible.

More to follow. Early results have shown a 4000x improvement in performance over python langchain on synthetic benchmarks.
