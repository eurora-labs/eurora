# Decision Log

This file tracks key architectural and design decisions made during the project's development.
2025-04-25 21:14:27 - Initial creation of Memory Bank.

[2025-05-14 18:53:02] - Implemented Context Chip component

**Decision:** Created a reusable Context Chip component based on the styling from Transcript.svelte.

**Rationale:**

- Extracted styling from Transcript.svelte to create a reusable component
- Implemented as a UI component following the same pattern as the Badge component
- Added variants to support different use cases (default, primary, secondary, destructive, outline)
- Included support for click handlers and links
- Used backdrop blur effect for a modern, translucent appearance

**Implementation Details:**

- Created component in packages/ui/src/custom-components/ui/context-chip
- Used tailwind-variants (tv) for variant styling
- Added proper TypeScript typing for variants
- Exported component in the main UI package index.ts
- Created documentation page in the docs app

[2025-05-17 14:19:55] - Modified Context Chip component for platform-specific styling

**Decision:** Updated the Context Chip component to use different background styles based on the platform.

**Rationale:**

- Linux desktop app requires a solid background due to platform-specific rendering differences
- Non-Linux platforms can benefit from the modern backdrop blur effect
- Maintaining consistent visual appearance across platforms while addressing platform-specific requirements

**Implementation Details:**

- Used CSS selectors to detect when the body has the "linux-app" class (Linux desktop app)
- For Linux: Applied solid background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2) without backdrop filter
- For other platforms: Used transparent background with backdrop-filter: blur(6px)
- Ensured backward compatibility with existing usage of the component

[2025-05-24 12:41:02] - Migrated frontend from regular Tauri commands to TauRPC procedures

**Decision:** Updated the frontend TypeScript code to use TauRPC instead of direct Tauri invoke calls.

**Rationale:**

- TauRPC provides fully-typed IPC communication between Rust backend and TypeScript frontend
- Eliminates the need for manual type definitions and provides compile-time type safety
- Follows the existing pattern already established in the project with some procedures
- Improves developer experience with better autocomplete and error checking

**Implementation Details:**

- Updated `apps/desktop/src/routes/(launcher)/+page.svelte` to use TauRPC proxy
- Updated `apps/desktop/src/routes/(launcher)/api-key-form.svelte` to use TauRPC proxy
- Migrated the following function calls to TauRPC:
    - `check_api_key_exists()` → `taurpc.third_party.check_api_key_exists()`
    - `save_api_key()` → `taurpc.third_party.save_api_key()`
    - `initialize_openai_client()` → `taurpc.third_party.initialize_openai_client()`
    - `resize_launcher_window()` → `taurpc.window.resize_launcher_window()`
    - `send_query()` → `taurpc.send_query()` (for the main query functionality)
- Left some functions as fallbacks to regular invoke calls where TauRPC procedures don't exist yet:
    - `list_activities` (not yet implemented in TauRPC)
    - `list_conversations` (not yet implemented in TauRPC)
- Used existing TauRPC bindings generated in `packages/tauri-bindings/src/lib/gen/bindings.ts`

[2025-05-25 12:42:00] - Conducted comprehensive critical analysis of eur-activity crate

**Decision:** Performed detailed architectural analysis and identified critical issues in the eur-activity crate that prevent production use.

**Rationale:**

- The crate has fundamental compilation issues (invalid Rust edition "2024")
- Multiple runtime panic risks from todo!() implementations and expect() calls
- Poor error handling and hardcoded configuration values
- Missing comprehensive testing and documentation
- Memory and performance concerns with image handling

**Implementation Details:**

- Created critical-issues-analysis.md documenting 10 major issues with severity ratings
- Developed architecture-overview.md explaining the strategy pattern and component relationships
- Built implementation-roadmap.md with 4-phase development plan spanning 8-10 weeks
- Designed testing-strategy.md with comprehensive unit, integration, and performance testing approach
- Created README.md as documentation index with quick start guide and development guidelines
- All documentation includes proper file references and line numbers for traceability

[2025-05-25 12:45:45] - Updated eur-activity documentation based on user feedback

**Decision:** Corrected documentation to reflect that Rust edition 2024 is valid and extension IDs should remain hardcoded.

**Rationale:**

- Rust edition 2024 has been released and is valid for use
- Extension IDs are intentionally hardcoded as they serve as identifiers for specific asset processing pipelines
- The application architecture will support a large number of different asset types, each requiring specific processing identification
- Hardcoded IDs provide stable references for the asset processing system

**Implementation Details:**

- Removed Cargo.toml edition issue from critical issues analysis
- Updated priority recommendations to focus on TODO implementations and error handling
- Added explanation that extension IDs identify asset processing pipelines
- Clarified that extension IDs will remain hardcoded for architectural reasons
- Updated roadmap to include asset type registry and processing pipeline documentation
- Modified README to reflect corrected understanding of design decisions

[2025-05-25 12:55:55] - Completed Phase 1 implementation of eur-activity crate critical fixes

**Decision:** Successfully implemented all Phase 1 critical fixes for the eur-activity crate as planned.

**Rationale:**

- Eliminated all runtime panics by implementing missing TODO methods
- Added proper error handling with custom ActivityError types
- Implemented comprehensive timestamp tracking for snapshots
- Added basic unit test coverage (15 tests passing)
- Fixed parameter ordering bug in strategy selection

**Implementation Details:**

- Task 1: Added timestamp fields to ArticleSnapshot and YoutubeSnapshot structs with proper constructors
- Task 2: Implemented gather_state() method returning JSON representation of browser activity state
- Task 3: Created custom ActivityError enum with proper From implementations and safe image loading helper
- Task 4: Added 15 unit tests covering core functionality, strategy selection, and error handling

- Fixed critical bug in select_strategy_for_process parameter ordering
- All tests now pass without warnings

[2025-05-25 14:33:00] - Fixed Linux focus tracker to detect Chrome tab switches

**Decision:** Modified the Linux X11 focus tracker to monitor window title changes in addition to active window changes.

**Rationale:**

- The macOS implementation reports focus events for both window switches AND tab switches in Chrome
- The Linux implementation only reported focus events for window switches, missing Chrome tab switches
- This inconsistency meant the timeline tracking behaved differently across platforms
- Chrome tab switches change the window title but not the active window in X11

**Implementation Details:**

- Added tracking of the currently focused window (`current_focused_window`)
- Modified event handling to listen for both `_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW` and `_NET_WM_NAME` property changes
- When active window changes: stop monitoring old window, start monitoring new window for title changes
- When title changes on focused window: emit focus event with updated title
- Maintains the same event-driven approach while capturing title changes within the same window
- Added proper cleanup of event monitoring when windows change focus

[2025-05-27 09:45:00] - Implemented JWT authentication for OCR service using tonic interceptor

**Decision:** Added JWT token validation to the OCR service to ensure only authenticated users can access image transcription functionality.

- Modified main.rs to share JWT configuration between auth and OCR services
- Added proper error handling with Status::unauthenticated for invalid tokens
- Included logging for authentication success/failure events

**Security Features:**

- Validates JWT signature using shared secret
- Ensures token type is "access" (not refresh)
- Checks token expiration automatically via jsonwebtoken library
- Extracts user information from validated claims for logging
- Returns proper gRPC status codes for authentication failures

[2025-05-27 09:51:00] - Refactored JWT authentication to use shared structures in eur-auth crate

**Decision:** Moved duplicated JWT structures and validation functions from individual services to a shared eur-auth crate to eliminate code duplication.

**Rationale:**

- Eliminates code duplication between auth-service and ocr-service
- Provides a single source of truth for JWT-related functionality
- Improves maintainability and consistency across services
- Follows DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Makes it easier to add JWT authentication to additional services

**Implementation Details:**

**Rationale:**

- Provides consistency across all gRPC services in the project
- Follows the established pattern from the OCR service implementation
- Centralizes all authentication logic within the gRPC trait implementation
- Improves maintainability by having a single, consistent service architecture

**Implementation Details:**

- Added missing RPC calls to proto/auth_service.proto:
    - `rpc Register (RegisterRequest) returns (LoginResponse);`
    - `rpc RefreshToken (RefreshTokenRequest) returns (LoginResponse);`
- Added corresponding message definitions:
    - `RegisterRequest` with username, email, password, and optional display_name
    - `RefreshTokenRequest` with refresh_token field
- Updated imports to include new proto message types
- Added Default implementation for AuthService with proper database connection
- Implemented missing trait methods in ProtoAuthService:

- Proper error handling with appropriate gRPC status codes
- Maintains existing security features and JWT functionality

[2025-05-27 11:27:00] - Fixed naming conflict and async issues in AuthService implementation

**Decision:** Resolved compilation errors in the AuthService by fixing method naming conflicts and removing problematic Default implementation.

**Rationale:**

- The refresh_token method name conflicted between the trait implementation and internal method
- The Default implementation tried to create a DatabaseManager synchronously, but DatabaseManager::new() is async
- Removing Default implementation ensures proper service initialization with database connections

**Implementation Details:**

- Renamed internal method from `refresh_token()` to `refresh_access_token()` to avoid naming conflict
- Updated trait implementation to call the renamed `refresh_access_token()` method
- Removed Default implementation that caused async/sync mismatch with DatabaseManager::new()
- Service now requires proper initialization through the `new()` constructor with database connection
- All compilation errors resolved, cargo check passes successfully

**Benefits:**

[2025-06-03 13:21:00] - Implemented modern onboarding UI with card-based layout

**Decision:** Created a visually pleasing onboarding page with centered title and side-by-side clickable cards for authentication and local connection options.

**Rationale:**

- User requested specific layout: title in middle top, left card for "Log in or Sign up", right card for "Connect to local"
- Needed to follow existing project design patterns using backdrop blur effects and Tailwind CSS
- Cards should be clickable and visually appealing to improve user experience
- Design should be consistent with the project's existing launcher component styling

**Implementation Details:**

- Implemented responsive grid layout (1 column on mobile, 2 columns on desktop)
- Added gradient background with blue-to-purple theme for visual appeal
- Created two distinct cards with different color schemes:
    - Left card: Blue theme for authentication (login/signup)
    - Right card: Green theme for local connection
- Added hover effects and transitions for better interactivity
- Used existing UI components from @eurora/ui package (Card, Button)
- Maintained Linux compatibility with fallback styling (no backdrop filter)
- Added proper spacing and typography hierarchy with centered title
- Implemented proper semantic structure with Card.Header, Card.Content sections

**Benefits:**

- Professional and modern user interface
- Clear visual distinction between the two main onboarding paths
- Responsive design that works on different screen sizes
- Consistent with project's existing design system
- Accessible and user-friendly layout
- Smooth animations and hover effects for better UX

[2025-06-05 15:57:40] - Implemented comprehensive Google OAuth integration for eur-auth-service

**Decision:** Split Google OAuth implementation into two parts: URL generation and callback handling with third-party login integration.

**Rationale:**

- Separation of concerns: URL generation for redirecting users vs. callback handling for processing authorization codes
- Integration with existing auth service architecture using third-party credentials
- Follows OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow best practices
- Enables seamless user registration and login via Google accounts

**Implementation Details:**

- **URL Generation (`google.rs`):**
    - Created `GoogleOAuthClient` for generating authorization URLs
    - Uses oauth2 crate with proper Google OAuth endpoints
    - Requests OpenID Connect scopes (openid, email, profile)
    - Returns authorization URL and CSRF state token

- **Callback Handler (`callback_handler.rs`):**
    - Created Axum-based HTTP server to handle OAuth callbacks
    - Exchanges authorization code for access tokens
    - Fetches user info from Google's userinfo endpoint
    - Calls auth service login with third-party credentials

- **Auth Service Integration:**
    - Implemented `handle_third_party_login()` method in AuthService
    - Validates Google ID tokens by fetching user info
    - Creates new users automatically if they don't exist
    - Generates JWT tokens for authenticated users
    - Supports both existing and new user flows

- **Dependencies Added:**
    - `reqwest` for HTTP requests to Google APIs
    - `serde_urlencoded` for parsing callback query parameters
    - `url` for URL parsing utilities

**Benefits:**

- Complete OAuth 2.0 flow implementation
- Automatic user registration for new Google users
- Secure token validation and user authentication
- Extensible architecture for additional OAuth providers (GitHub, etc.)
- Integration with existing JWT token system

[2025-06-06 11:37:00] - Implemented OAuth state management for secure third-party authentication

- Added oauth_state table support in eur-remote-db with PKCE verifier storage
- Modified get_third_party_auth_url to generate and store temporary state/verifier pairs
- Enhanced handle_google_login to validate state parameters against stored values
- Updated Google OAuth client to support custom state parameters
- Implemented state consumption to prevent replay attacks
- Added proper CSRF protection for OAuth callback flow

[2025-06-10 14:31:00] - Refactored PDF and Article watchers to follow YouTube watcher architectural pattern

**Decision:** Migrated PDF and Article content script watchers to extend the base Watcher class from chrome-ext-shared package, following the same pattern as the YouTube watcher.

**Rationale:**

- Establishes consistent architecture across all content script watchers
- Leverages shared base class for common functionality (listen, handleNew, handleGenerateAssets, handleGenerateSnapshot)
- Improves maintainability by centralizing watcher behavior patterns
- Follows DRY principle by eliminating duplicated message handling logic
- Provides type safety through shared interfaces and message types

**Implementation Details:**

- **PDF Watcher Refactoring:**
    - Created `types.ts` with PdfMessageType and WatcherParams interfaces
    - Refactored PdfWatcher class to extend Watcher<WatcherParams>
    - Implemented all required abstract methods from base class
    - Added chrome-ext-shared dependency to package.json
    - Updated vite.config.ts with chrome-ext-shared alias
    - Maintained existing PDF parsing functionality using PDFViewerApplication

- **Article Watcher Refactoring:**
    - Created `types.ts` with ArticleMessageType and WatcherParams interfaces
    - Refactored ArticleWatcher class to extend Watcher<WatcherParams>
    - Implemented all required abstract methods from base class
    - Added chrome-ext-shared dependency to package.json
    - Updated vite.config.ts with chrome-ext-shared alias
    - Used create() function with ProtoNativeArticleAssetSchema for proper protobuf message creation
    - Maintained existing Readability-based article parsing functionality

**Benefits:**

- Consistent message handling across all content script watchers
- Shared type definitions prevent interface mismatches
- Easier to add new watcher types following established pattern
- Centralized error handling and response patterns
- Better code organization and separation of concerns
